Phase 1. Collect speaker’s speech samples. 
Objective: Speak (or read a script for more than 2 minute continuously, the longer the better but less than 5 minutes) in front of the Microphone ONE. (ATTENTION: Only speak in front of the Microphone ONE)
1.	Go to the ‘1-Recording’ folder.
2.	Be ready for the speech. 
3.	Run M2FEDRecorder.exe. 
4.	Select the correct device if required. Just enter the corresponding number and press ENTER. This step is required only at the first time you run this program. Later, it will load the previous setting. In case, you do not want to use the previous setting, delete the file ‘settings.txt’.
5.	Start speaking immediately. Make sure it only records one person’s voice (in other words, everyone else should be quiet).
6.	After finishing speaking, press 's' to end this program. 
7.	Go to the ‘Recording_samples’ folder, and find the latest one (the one with the newest timestamp). Rename it accordingly (for example, the person ID and date. The file name does not have particular requirement. Make it understandable and well-organized for your records).
8.	Do the same procedure (step 2 – step 7) for the next recording of the next person.
