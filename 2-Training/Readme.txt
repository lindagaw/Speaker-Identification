Phase 2. Train speaker models.
1.	Go to the ‘2-Training’ folder.
2.	Copy the recordings from the ‘Recording_samples’ folder in the first step by following these steps.
a.	Go to the 'singles' folder. DO NOT REMOVE the empty folder '0-nonFamily'. (In the 'singles' folder should contain each speaker's recording sample file. For each speaker, his/her recordings should be in a separate folder. The folder name can be anything but recommend to be the speaker name/number in order to distinguish them. ) For example, it can be: Create a new folder named "1-NAME-A", and put all the recordings belong to person NAME-A in to this folder. Create a new folder named "1-NAME-B", and put all the recordings belong to person NAME-B in to this folder.
3.	After copying all the recordings into their corresponding folders, check each folder and make sure one folder for one person, and the total number of folders is the same as the total number of speakers.
4.	Run M2FEDTraining.exe. It should print a lot of logs on screen and finally it will create a file named 'models_1024' in the folder. DO NOT make any changes of the file 'models_ubm1024'.
